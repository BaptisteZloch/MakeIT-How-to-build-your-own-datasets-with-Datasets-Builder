# MakeIT-How-to-build-your-own-datasets-with-Datasets-Builder
This repository is dedicated to a software I created and I decided to share with the community. It corresponds to the 3rd tutorial of my YouTube channel MakeIT. The goal of this software is to use serial communication with an Arduino to fill an Excel spreadsheet. You can build your own datasets using a large amount of sensors.
